## Step 1: Install Visual Studio 2022 Community

### What is Visual Studio?
Visual Studio is like Microsoft Word, but for writing code instead of documents. It's free and has everything you need to build applications.

### Download and Install:
1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
2. **Go to**: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
3. **Click the big blue "Download" button**
4. **Wait for the download to finish** (this might take 10-15 minutes)
5. **Run the downloaded file** (it will be called something like `vs_community.exe`)
6. **Click "Yes"** when Windows asks for permission

### Visual Studio Installer Setup:
1. **When the installer opens**, you'll see a list of "workloads"
2. **Look for ".NET desktop development"** and check the box next to it
3. **Also check "ASP.NET and web development"** if you see it
4. **Click "Install"** in the bottom right corner
5. **Wait for installation** (this will take 20-30 minutes)
6. **Click "Restart"** when it's done

### Verify Installation:
1. **Click the Windows Start button**
2. **Type "Visual Studio"**
3. **Click on "Visual Studio 2022"** when it appears
4. **If it opens successfully, you're good to go!**

## Step 2: Install .NET 9.0 SDK

### What is .NET SDK?
.NET SDK is like the engine that runs your application. It's usually included with Visual Studio, but let's make sure you have the right version.

### Check if it's already installed:
1. **Open Command Prompt** (see Step 1 in the database setup guide)
2. **Type**: `dotnet --version`
3. **Press Enter**
4. **If you see a version number** (like 9.0.xxx), you're all set!
5. **If you see an error**, continue to the installation steps below

### Install .NET 9.0 SDK:
1. **Go to**: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0
2. **Click "Download .NET 9.0 SDK"** (the big blue button)
3. **Wait for the download to finish**
4. **Run the downloaded file** (it will be called something like `dotnet-sdk-9.0.xxx.exe`)
5. **Click "Yes"** when Windows asks for permission
6. **Follow the installation wizard** (just click "Next" on each screen)
7. **Click "Finish"** when done

### Verify Installation:
1. **Close and reopen Command Prompt**
2. **Type**: `dotnet --version`
3. **Press Enter**
4. **You should see**: `9.0.xxx` (some version number)

## Step 3: Install Git (Optional but Recommended)

### What is Git?
Git helps you save different versions of your code and share it with others. It's like "Save As" but much more powerful.

### Download and Install:
1. **Go to**: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. **Click "Download for Windows"**
3. **Wait for the download to finish**
4. **Run the downloaded file** (it will be called something like `Git-2.xx.x-64-bit.exe`)
5. **Click "Yes"** when Windows asks for permission
6. **Follow the installation wizard** (the default settings are fine)
7. **Click "Next" on each screen until you reach "Finish"**

### Verify Installation:
1. **Open Command Prompt**
2. **Type**: `git --version`
3. **Press Enter**
4. **You should see**: `git version 2.xx.x`

## Step 4: Install SQLite Browser (Optional)

### What is SQLite Browser?
This tool lets you look at your database in a nice, visual way - like opening an Excel file.

### Download and Install:
1. **Go to**: https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
2. **Click "Download"** next to the Windows version
3. **Wait for the download to finish**
4. **Run the downloaded file** (it will be called something like `DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.12.2-win64.msi`)
5. **Click "Yes"** when Windows asks for permission
6. **Follow the installation wizard** (default settings are fine)
7. **Click "Finish"** when done

### How to Use:
1. **Open SQLite Browser** from your Start menu
2. **Click "Open Database"**
3. **Navigate to your project folder** and find `app.db`
4. **Click "Open"**
5. **You can now see your database tables!**
